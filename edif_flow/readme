Description: stopwatch.edf is a top level EDIF netlist of a simple runners stopwatch design.
 
In the runner’s stopwatch design, there are five external inputs and four external output
buses. The system clock is an externally generated signal. The following list summarizes
the input and output signals of the design.

Inputs:

• strtstop : Starts and stops the stopwatch. This is an active low signal which acts like the
start/stop button on a runner’s stopwatch.

• reset : Puts the stopwatch in clocking mode and resets the time to 0:00:00.

• clk : Externally generated system clock. 

• mode : Toggles between clocking and timer modes. This input is only functional while the
clock or timer is not counting.

• lap_load : This is a dual function signal. In clocking mode it displays the current clock value in
the ‘Lap’ display area. In timer mode it loads the pre assigned values from the ROM to
the timer display when the timer is not counting.


Outputs:
• lcd_e, lcd_rs, lcd_rw : These outputs are the control signals for the LCD display of the Spartan-3A demo board used to display the stopwatch times.

• sf_d[7:0] : Provides the data values for the LCD display.
